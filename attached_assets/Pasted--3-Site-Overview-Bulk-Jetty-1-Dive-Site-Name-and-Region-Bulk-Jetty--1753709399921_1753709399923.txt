## 3. 🌍 **Site Overview: Bulk Jetty**

1. **Dive Site Name and Region**
    
    **Bulk Jetty**, located in **Kwinana**, just south of Perth, Western Australia.
    
2. **Image Header**
    
    Photos typically show the long industrial jetty extending into Cockburn Sound, with pylons disappearing into the blue-green water—often revealing schooling fish and marine growth along the structure.
    
3. **Diver Experience Level & Certification Needed**
    
    Suitable for **beginners to intermediate** divers. Entry and navigation are relatively easy, but awareness of current and visibility is important.
    
4. **Location Description and coordinates: 32°12'36.0"S 115°46'02.3"E**
    
    Near **Kwinana Beach**, in the industrial maritime zone south of Fremantle. Not within a marine park. No GPS coordinates listed, but access is straightforward from Kwinana Beach car parks.
    
5. **Access Type**
    
    **Shore dive**, with a surface swim to the jetty structure. Be prepared for a walk across the beach and shallow entry.
    
6. **Depth Range**
    
    Varies from **3 to 10 metres**, depending on tide and distance along the jetty.
    
7. **Entry Conditions**
    
    Enter from the beach—soft sand with a gradual slope. Watch for boat traffic near the jetty, and swim to the pylons before descending.

## 🌊 **Conditions**

1. **Best Time to Dive**
    
    Ideal during **low wind conditions and slack tide**. Early mornings often provide the calmest water and best visibility.
    
2. **Water Temperature**
    
    Typically ranges from **18°C (winter)** to **24°C (summer)**.
    
3. **Visibility**
    
    Generally **5–10 metres**, but can drop due to swell or sediment. After storms, visibility is significantly reduced.
    
4. **Current and Surge**
    
    Light current along the jetty, though surge can build near the entrance if the wind picks up. Be mindful of boat wash and swell in exposed areas.

## 🐠 **Marine Life & Ecosystem**

1. **Marine Species Commonly Seen**
    - Schools of **scalyfin**, **bullseyes**, and **herring**
    - **Octopuses**, **seahorses**, and **cuttlefish** hiding in pylons
    - Occasional sightings of **port jackson sharks** or **stingrays**
    - **Nudibranchs** and **soft corals** on the pylon structure
2. **Habitat Type**
    
    **Artificial reef**, formed by jetty pylons and industrial structure colonised by marine growth and invertebrates.
    
3. **Seasonal Marine Life Events**
    
    Warmer months may bring more **juvenile fish**, and spring–summer may see **cuttlefish and squid** activity.
    
4. **Conservation Info**
    
    Not a declared marine park, but general rules around fishing and marine life handling apply. Divers should be cautious and avoid touching or disturbing marine organisms.

## 🗺️ **Dive Map**

1. **Dive Site Layout**
    
    The jetty runs straight into the ocean with evenly spaced pylons. Divers usually follow the **left or right side of the structure**, exploring marine growth on pylons, checking under crossbeams, and looking for cryptic species along the seabed. Swim out on the surface, descend at a central point, and return along the opposite side.
    
2. **Community Notes**
    
    Local divers suggest **avoiding busy times due to boat traffic**. Some have shared **sketches of the pylon layout**, which can be helpful for planning entry/exit points.

## 📸 **Extras**

1. **Visual Media**
    
    Photos on the site highlight schooling fish between pylons, macro life like nudibranchs and seahorses, and the industrial contrast of rusting beams and soft corals.
    
2. **Unique or Memorable Features**
    
    The contrast between industrial structure and natural marine colonisation makes Bulk Jetty a great urban ecology dive. Good for photography, especially macro.
    
3. **User Experience**
    
    Divers often describe it as **surprisingly rich in life**, despite the industrial location. It's appreciated for **easy access, reliable sightings**, and low depth range. However, **visibility can be hit or miss** depending on recent weather.

Here are two mini-lesson topics inspired by the dive site:

1. **Artificial Reefs & Urban Marine Habitats**
    
    Learn how man-made structures like jetties, shipwrecks, and sea walls become important marine ecosystems, attracting fish, algae, and invertebrates.
    
2. **Cephalopods of Cockburn Sound**
    
    Discover more about the cuttlefish, octopuses, and squid species found in southern WA—how they use camouflage, their intelligence, and why they love places like Bulk Jetty.
