Key Facts: - Large tuskfish with black spot at base of dorsal fin 
- Is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite 🐟
That means:
It starts life as a female and later changes into a male — usually when it grows larger or when a dominant male is absent.
This sex change is common among wrasses and tuskfishes (family Labridae) and helps balance reproduction in their social groups — one large male defends a territory with several females, and when he disappears, the largest female transforms to take his place.
Sequential hermaphrodite: A sequential hermaphrodite is an organism that changes sex during its lifetime — starting as one sex and later becoming the other. 
There are two main types:
• Protandry: starts as a male, later changes to female (e.g. clownfish 🐠).
• Protogyny: starts as a female, later changes to male (e.g. many wrasses and parrotfish 🐟).
This ability is usually triggered by social or environmental cues — like the absence of a dominant male or changes in population structure — and helps maximize reproductive success in different conditions.
