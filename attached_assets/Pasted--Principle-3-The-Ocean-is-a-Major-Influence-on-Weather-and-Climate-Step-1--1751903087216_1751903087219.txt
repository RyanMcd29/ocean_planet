### 🌊 **Principle 3: The Ocean is a Major Influence on Weather and Climate**

---

**👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Did you know the ocean controls much of our planet’s weather?

Because the ocean stores and moves heat, it plays a key role in shaping weather patterns and global climate. Understanding the ocean means understanding how weather works — from sea breezes to cyclones.

---

**🌍 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept: Heat and Weather**

- The ocean absorbs most of the sun’s heat reaching Earth.
- Warm water evaporates, forming clouds and rain.
- Ocean currents, like the El Niño and La Niña systems, affect rainfall, droughts, and storms globally.
- Tropical cyclones form over warm ocean waters and gain strength from heat.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What causes tropical cyclones to form?

A) Cold ocean water

B) Ocean pollution

C) Warm ocean water ✅

D) Tides

---

**🌊 Step 3 of 5 – Ocean & Climate Connection**

- The ocean acts like Earth’s heat engine — moving warm water from the equator to the poles and cold water back again.
- This movement shapes climate zones.
- For example, the **Leeuwin Current** keeps Western Australia’s coast warmer than other areas at the same latitude.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which of the following is TRUE?

A) The ocean stores little heat

B) Ocean currents don’t impact climate

C) The Leeuwin Current warms Western Australia’s coast ✅

D) All oceans have the same temperature

---

**🔁 Step 4 of 5 – Changes and Consequences**

- As oceans warm due to climate change, weather becomes more extreme — more heatwaves, storms, and sea level rise.
- Melting polar ice also affects ocean circulation.
- Tracking ocean temperatures helps predict climate patterns.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

What is one result of warming oceans?

A) Less rainfall

B) Stronger storms and rising seas ✅

C) Colder winters globally

D) Slower ocean currents only

---

**🌱 Step 5 of 5 – What You Can Do**

Understanding how the ocean drives weather and climate helps us prepare and adapt.

**What you can do:**

- Reduce your carbon footprint (e.g., less driving, more renewables)
- Support climate-resilient coastal communities
- Stay informed: follow ocean and climate science

🎉 Great job! You’ve completed Principle 3 of 7.

## 🌱 Ocean Literacy Principle 4: The Ocean Makes Earth Habitable

---

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

The reason Earth is livable isn’t just because of land, plants, or even oxygen — it’s because of the ocean.

From producing most of the oxygen we breathe to regulating temperature and supporting weather patterns, the ocean is Earth's life support system.

---

### ☀️ Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept: Life Support System

- The ocean absorbs **heat from the sun**, distributing it around the globe via currents
- **Phytoplankton**, tiny ocean plants, produce **at least 50% of the oxygen** we breathe
- The ocean **stores carbon dioxide**, helping regulate Earth’s climate

Without the ocean’s influence, Earth would be an unrecognizable — and likely uninhabitable — place.

---

### 🌊 Step 3 of 5 – Ocean’s Role in Habitability

- 🌬️ **Moderating Weather:** Ocean currents like the Gulf Stream and the Leeuwin Current help transport heat and influence rainfall and storms
- 💨 **Oxygen Creation:** Phytoplankton are the ocean’s “green lungs,” absorbing sunlight and CO₂ and releasing oxygen
- 🧊 **Climate Buffer:** The ocean acts like a giant thermostat, absorbing about **90% of the excess heat** from greenhouse gases

Fun fact: Without the ocean absorbing carbon and heat, climate change would already be far more extreme.

### ✅ Step 4 of 5 – Quick Quiz

1️⃣ What produces at least 50% of the world’s oxygen?

A) Forests

B) Ocean waves

C) Phytoplankton ✅

D) Coral reefs

2️⃣ What role do ocean currents play in Earth's systems?

A) They only affect fish migration

B) They help distribute heat and regulate climate ✅

C) They clean up pollution

D) They stay in one place

3️⃣ What would happen without the ocean’s climate buffering?

A) More oxygen

B) Earth would cool dramatically

C) The planet would be hotter and storms more severe ✅

D) No change at all

### 🌍 Step 5 of 5 – What You Can Do

Realize that protecting the ocean means protecting Earth’s habitability.

Everything is connected.

**Try this:**

- Support climate solutions that protect oceans
- Reduce your carbon footprint (e.g., public transport, energy efficiency)
- Share this lesson and raise awareness about the ocean’s invisible role in sustaining life

🎉 Great job! You’ve completed Principle 4 of 7.

## 🔁 Ocean Literacy Principle 5: The Ocean Supports a Great Diversity of Life and Ecosystems

---

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

The ocean is home to most of the life on Earth.

From coral reefs to deep-sea vents, it holds more biodiversity than any other place on the planet.

Whether it’s colourful reef fish or microbes in the deep, every form of life plays a role in the ocean’s web of life.

---

### 🐚 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept: Biodiversity

- Over **230,000 marine species** are known — but scientists estimate **millions more** are yet to be discovered
- Marine ecosystems range from **tidepools and kelp forests** to **polar seas and abyssal plains**
- Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support **25% of all marine life**

Life in the ocean is interconnected, and every species — big or small — matters.

---

### 🧬 Step 3 of 5 – How Ocean Life Works Together

- 🦐 **Food webs:** Tiny plankton feed small fish, which feed bigger fish, which feed sharks and humans
- 🐠 **Habitats:** Coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, and kelp forests provide food and shelter for many species
- 🦑 **Adaptations:** Deep-sea creatures use bioluminescence, while others migrate vast distances across ocean basins

This diversity is not just beautiful — it’s essential for healthy oceans and human wellbeing.

🎉 Nice work! You’ve completed Principle 5 of 7.

## 🌍 Principle 6: The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected.

---

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

You might not see the ocean every day, but it affects your life more than you might think — and your actions affect it in return.

From the seafood we eat to the oxygen we breathe, the ocean is deeply linked to human survival, culture, and wellbeing.

---

### 🔁 Step 2 of 5 – Key Connections

- **Oxygen**: Over **50% of the oxygen** we breathe comes from ocean plankton.
- **Climate**: The ocean absorbs heat and carbon, helping to regulate Earth’s climate.
- **Food & Livelihoods**: Fisheries support the livelihoods of **over 3 billion people** globally.
- **Transport**: Around **90% of global trade** moves by sea.
- **Cultural Identity**: Many coastal communities and Indigenous cultures are deeply tied to the ocean spiritually and historically.

---

### 🚨 Step 3 of 5 – Impacts Go Both Ways

Humans also impact the ocean:

- **Pollution**: Plastic waste, chemicals, and sewage harm marine life and ecosystems.
- **Climate Change**: Rising emissions cause ocean warming, acidification, and sea level rise.
- **Overfishing**: Excessive fishing reduces fish stocks and damages marine habitats.
- **Noise Pollution**: Ships and industry disrupt marine animals’ communication.

This is why **ocean stewardship** is a shared human responsibility.

🎉 Great job! You’ve completed **Ocean Literacy Principle 6**.

## 🌊 **Ocean Literacy Principle 7**

**The ocean is largely unexplored.**

---

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

Despite all our knowledge, **most of the ocean remains a mystery**.

In fact, **more than 80% of the ocean is unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored**.

We know more about the surface of the Moon or Mars than we do about the deep ocean — which covers over 70% of our planet!

---

### 🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Why So Little Is Explored?

Exploring the ocean is **extremely difficult** because of:

- **Depth and pressure** – The deeper we go, the more pressure builds up
- **Darkness** – Sunlight doesn’t reach below 1,000 meters
- **Technology limits** – We need specialized submersibles, ROVs, and sensors

Yet, new discoveries are made regularly — from **unknown species** to **underwater volcanoes** and even **lost shipwrecks**.

> 🌟 Scientists believe millions of species may still be undiscovered in the deep ocean!
