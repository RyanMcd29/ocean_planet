Please update my OceanPlanet project so that every mini-lesson in the Learn section can have a “Sources & Further Reading” slide at the end.

What I want:

Each lesson should support an optional Sources & Further Reading section.

If a lesson has sources defined in its data, the app should automatically add a final slide titled “Sources & Further Reading” that lists those sources as clickable links (opening in a new tab).

If a lesson has no sources defined, nothing should break – it just won’t show that final slide.

Apply this now to the Maritime History mini-lesson (Long Jetty):

Add a Sources & Further Reading section with these four items:

WA Museum – Long Jetty, Fremantle Maritime Heritage Trail

https://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-heritage-trails/fremantle/long-jetty

Heritage Council WA – Fremantle Long Jetty Site Record

https://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/1f4f05c0-fbe9-4b8f-8f79-3c6a1a95a7a2

WA Shipwrecks Museum – Maritime Archaeology of Fremantle

https://museum.wa.gov.au/museums/wa-shipwrecks

City of Fremantle – Bathers Beach Precinct History

https://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/facilities/bathers-beach

And for Camilla Wreck

Important:

Make this system reusable so I can easily add sources to other lessons just by editing the lesson data (not the components).

Keep the existing Learn navigation, slide controls, and layout working exactly as they are.
