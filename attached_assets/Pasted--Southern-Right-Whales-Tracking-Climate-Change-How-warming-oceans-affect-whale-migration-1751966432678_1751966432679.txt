# 🐋 Southern Right Whales: Tracking Climate Change

🔥 *How warming oceans affect whale migrations*

---

### 👣 **Step 1 of 5 – Why track whales in warming waters?**

Southern right whales were almost wiped out by hunting in the 1800s. Protected since 1935, they’re slowly coming back—but they now face a new threat: **climate change.**

🌊 Scientists are racing to answer big questions:

- Where exactly do they feed?
- How might warmer oceans affect their food supply?
- Could this impact their ability to reproduce?

🧭 These answers are hidden in their migration paths—many of which stretch over **6,500 km** into the Southern Ocean.

### 🧠 **Step 2 of 5 – How the research works**

To understand where whales go and why, scientists use a combination of:

- **Satellite tags** – Track whales as they travel to feeding grounds in Antarctica, the **Kerguelen Islands**, and **Crozet Islands**
- **Genetic samples** – Reveal connections between whales in Australia, New Zealand, and even **South Africa**
- **Stable isotope analysis** – Tells scientists what the whales are eating and where they’ve been feeding

🐳 The projects are named:

- **Tohorā Voyages** (New Zealand – "whale journeys")
- **Mirnong Maat** (Australia – "whale travel path" in Noongar language)

### 🌐 **Step 3 of 5 – What We're Learning**

🌍 Southern right whales are revealing surprising new migration patterns:

- Some travel in **completely different directions**, not just to Antarctica but also to the **Kerguelen Islands** and **Crozet Islands**
- There is **significant overlap** in feeding zones used by whales from **Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa**
- These international connections were previously unknown—one whale from New Zealand (*Whitu*) even reached shallow coastal waters off WA

🧬 Scientists are using:

- **Satellite tracking** to map long-range movements
- **Genetic and stable isotope analysis** to learn about their diet, origins, and population structure
- **Callosity pattern photo-ID** to track individual whales over time

🌡️ But there’s a challenge: as **climate change warms the ocean**, prey like **copepods and krill** may shift or decline.

If whales can't find enough high-quality food, it affects their ability to reproduce—especially for mother whales.

🛑 The **coastal areas** whales pass through before heading into the Southern Ocean—such as **Esperance**, **Augusta**, **Cheynes Beach**, and **Bremer Bay**—are essential for resting and feeding. These may soon become **marine protected zones** to help safeguard whale journeys.

### 🌈 **Special Sightings**

Some whales have been observed **migrating along the WA coastline**, including zones proposed for **marine protection** like:

- **Cheynes Beach**
- **Bremer Bay**
- **Twilight Cove**
- The **Fitzgerald Biosphere Reserve**

💬 Whale behaviour is being observed in detail to support the **Large Whale Disentanglement Team**—learning how whales move, rest, and respond helps improve rescue operations for entangled individuals.

🐋 One surprising sighting: A whale from **New Zealand’s Auckland Islands** swam all the way to WA’s south coast—showing international connections!

### 🧠 **Quick Facts**

- 🧬 The oldest DNA samples came from just **17 whales in the 1990s**—new samples now offer vital insights
- 🐋 Southern right whales feed mostly on **copepods and krill**
- 🧭 Tracking has revealed journeys over **6,500+ km** across open ocean
- 🌐 Two major research programs are:
    - **Tohorā Voyages** (NZ-based)
    - **Mirnong Maat** (WA-based, named in Noongar for “whale travel path”)
- 🛡️ Knowing **coastal movement patterns** helps shape marine protection plans around **human activity zones**
