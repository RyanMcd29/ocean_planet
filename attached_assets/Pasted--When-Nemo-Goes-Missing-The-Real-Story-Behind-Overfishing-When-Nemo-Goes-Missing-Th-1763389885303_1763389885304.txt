## **🌊When Nemo Goes Missing: The Real Story Behind Overfishing**

*Why too many nets in the water mean fewer fish in the sea.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Imagine diving on a reef and noticing that the clownfish — Nemo — isn’t there anymore. 🐠

Overfishing is like taking too many slices of cake before the party even starts. If we remove fish faster than they can reproduce, populations shrink, ecosystems suffer, and iconic species can vanish from our reefs.

---

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Overfishing** = catching fish at a rate faster than they can replace themselves.
- Leads to smaller fish, fewer big predators, and weakened food webs.
- Example: Many reef fish species have declined by **30–60%** in heavily fished areas.
- Removing herbivores (like parrotfish) can cause algae to smother coral reefs.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What does overfishing mean?

A) Catching fish with bigger boats

B) Catching fish faster than they can reproduce ✅

C) Fishing only at night

D) Fishing in deeper waters

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Species affected:** clownfish, groupers, snappers, tuna, sharks.
- **People involved:** commercial fishers, recreational fishers, seafood consumers.
- **Systems:** fisheries management, marine parks, quotas, size limits.
- **Real example:** In the Philippines, no-take reserves helped restore reef fish by **over 400%** in just a decade.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which species helps keep coral reefs healthy by grazing algae?

A) Parrotfish ✅

B) Tuna

C) Sharks

D) Clownfish

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Ecosystem collapse:** Too few predators → prey species explode → imbalance.
- **Food security risk:** 3 billion people worldwide depend on seafood as protein.
- **Bycatch:** Non-target species like turtles, dolphins, and seabirds die in nets.
- **Economic impacts:** Once stocks crash, it takes decades (or longer) to recover.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why is overfishing a global concern?

A) It only affects fishers’ income

B) It makes scuba diving more fun

C) It threatens ecosystems, food security, and economies ✅

D) It reduces shipping traffic

2. Which human activity contributes directly to overfishing?
    - A) Swimming

3. What management tool helps prevent overfishing?
    - A) Catch quotas and size limits ✅
    - B) Extra fishing licenses
    - C) Using bigger nets

### **🌱 Step 6 of 6 – What You Can Do**

🌊 Choose **sustainable seafood** with eco-labels (e.g. MSC-certified).

🐟 Respect **size and catch limits** when fishing.

📣 Support **marine protected areas** and share why they matter.

🍽 Try a “Fish-Free Friday” — reducing demand makes a difference.
