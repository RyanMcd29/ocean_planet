    **Trigg Beach**, located in the **northern suburbs of Perth**, Western Australia.
    
2. **Image Header**
    
    Likely features a wide sandy beach with surf rolling in, exposed rocky platforms, and blue-green water — typical of Perth’s outer metro beaches.
    
3. **Diver Experience Level & Certification Needed**
    
    Suitable for **intermediate to advanced divers**, especially those confident in handling surf entries and swell. Caution needed for surge and exit conditions.
    
4. **Location Description and coordinates: 31°52'33.2"S 115°45'06.6"E**
    
    Situated just north of Scarborough, Trigg is a well-known surf beach in Perth. The dive site lies near the southern end of the beach around the exposed rock outcrop and reef area.
    
5. **Access Type**
    
    **Shore dive** — entry is from the beach and requires surf navigation. A surface swim may be needed to reach reef areas depending on conditions.
    
6. **Depth Range**
    
    Typically ranges from **3 to 10 metres**, depending on swell and tide. Most interest is found in the shallower reef sections.
    
7. **Entry Conditions**
    
    Entry through **surf zone** can be challenging. Must be timed with wave sets. Entry over sand is easy, but surge and wave action can complicate it. Exiting in high swell is difficult and not recommended for beginners.

## 🌊 **Conditions**

1. **Best Time to Dive**
    
    Best during **calm summer mornings**, with light offshore winds and low swell. Avoid during or after storms.
    
2. **Water Temperature**
    
    Typically between **18°C (winter)** and **24°C (summer)**.
    
3. **Visibility**
    
    Usually **5 to 8 metres**, but can drop significantly due to surf stirring up sediment. Good visibility windows occur during calm periods.
    
4. **Current and Surge**
    
    **Surge and wave movement** are common due to exposure. Care required when approaching the reef or entering/exiting.
