**👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Have you ever dived under a jetty and seen it buzzing with life?

Jetty pylons are underwater pillars of biodiversity. They may be man-made, but they mimic natural reef structures — creating the perfect environment for creatures like anemones, nudibranchs, flatworms, and small reef fish. These vertical habitats offer shelter, food, and breeding grounds.

**🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept: What Makes Jetties Special?**

- **Hard surface:** Pylons give animals something solid to cling to — like rocks on a reef.
- **Shade and protection:** The overhead jetty blocks light, creating cool, safe spaces for shy species.
- **Vertical structure:** Offers microhabitats at different depths and light levels.
- **Water movement:** Waves and tides help bring in nutrients and oxygen — perfect for filter feeders like sponges and sea squirts.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

Why do filter feeders love jetty pylons?

A) They grow better in the sand

B) They need light to photosynthesise

C) The moving water brings food particles ✅

D) They only live in freshwater

**🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who Lives There?**

Jetty ecosystems are hotspots for *macro life* — small but spectacular species that thrive on and around pylons:

- **Anemones** – Use their tentacles to catch tiny food particles drifting by
- **Nudibranchs** – Colourful sea slugs that feed on sponges and sea squirts
- **Flatworms** – Graceful bottom dwellers with vivid patterns
- **Blennies & gobies** – Small fish that hide in cracks and crevices
- **Occasional visitors:** Seahorses, octopuses, and even cuttlefish

These creatures rely on the stability, structure, and nutrient flow that jetties provide.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which creature is a colourful sea slug found on jetty pylons?

A) Blenny

B) Nudibranch ✅

C) Flatworm

D) Sea urchin

**🌊 Step 4 of 5 – The Bigger Picture**

Though artificial, jetties act like **urban reefs**, enhancing local biodiversity in areas where natural reefs might be scarce.

But they’re not without risk:

- **Fishing lines and litter** can trap or injure marine life
- **Storm damage** can break fragile growth
- **Pollution** affects water quality and animal health

Community cleanups and responsible diving help protect these rich ecosystems.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

What is one threat to jetty ecosystems?

A) Coral bleaching

B) Marine heatwaves only

C) Discarded fishing line and plastic ✅

D) Too much biodiversity

**🌱 Step 5 of 5 – What You Can Do**

Every diver can help protect jetty biodiversity.

**Here’s how:**

- Dive gently — don’t kick up sediment or touch marine life
- Remove fishing line or debris if it’s safe to do so
- Share your sightings with marine researchers or citizen science platforms
- Encourage marine park protections for these unique spots
