### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

Did you know some whales travel thousands of kilometres every year… and we still don’t fully understand where they go? 🐋

Let’s dive into the cool tools and techniques scientists use to track these gentle giants and why it matters for the health of our oceans.

---

### 🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept

- Whales are hard to study because:
    - They live far offshore 🛳️
    - Spend most of their time underwater 🌊
    - Are tricky to approach safely
- Scientists use innovative methods to collect data:
    - Acoustic recorders (listening for whale calls)
    - Satellite tags (tracking movement)
    - Photo identification (like whale fingerprints!)

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What makes studying whales especially challenging?

A) They are too small to find

B) They live far offshore and underwater ✅

C) They don’t make any sound

D) They travel only short distances

---

### 🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?

- **Tools of the trade:**
    - Sonobuoys: listen to whale calls from 1,000 km away 🎧
    - Satellite tags: reveal migratory routes and feeding grounds 🛰️
    - Drones: collect tiny biopsy samples for DNA and health studies 🚁

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What does a satellite tag help scientists discover?

A) Whale weight

B) Migration and feeding areas ✅

C) Ocean salinity

D) The number of fish nearby

---

### 🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences

- Satellite tagging is invasive – it’s like a whale’s version of a microchip
- Researchers balance data needs with whale welfare
- Climate change is shrinking krill habitats – affecting the whales’ food supply

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why is it important to monitor whales’ movement and health?

A) To learn cool facts for documentaries

B) To help manage threats like fishing and climate change ✅

C) To track shark populations

D) To study ocean tides

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

Ever wondered how scientists collect data from massive whales in rough Antarctic seas? 🌬️❄️

This lesson explores the technology and methods driving modern whale research.

---

### 🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept

- Innovation helps overcome obstacles:
    - Sonobuoys track whale calls across vast distances
    - Acoustic moorings record year-round ocean sounds
    - Satellite tags show migration patterns in real time
- Newer tech includes drones for biopsy sampling and photogrammetry

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What’s a Sonobuoy originally designed for?

A) Tracking fish schools

B) Listening for submarines ✅

C) Measuring ocean temperature

D) Monitoring icebergs

---

### 🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?

- Australian Antarctic Division’s work includes:
    - Developing longer-lasting satellite tags
    - Using drones to collect blubber samples
    - Tracking Antarctic blue whales, humpbacks, and pygmy blue whales
- Whale data informs global conservation bodies like the IWC

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which species’ movement was discovered to include New Zealand during migration?

A) Southern right whales

B) East coast humpback whales ✅

C) Minke whales

D) Orcas

---

### 🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences

- Tags must balance data value with welfare concerns
- Climate change and ocean acidification threaten krill, a key food source
- Fishing pressure is growing despite strict limits

✅ **Quiz 3:**

What species consumes up to 4.9 million krill per day?

A) Humpback whale

B) Antarctic blue whale ✅

C) Sperm whale

D) Leopard seal

## 🌊 **Ecosystem Guardians: Managing Krill and Whales**

*Why saving krill means saving the ocean
Advanced*

### 👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction

Did you know 1/40th of all animal life on Earth is Antarctic krill? 🦐

This tiny crustacean supports whales, seals, penguins… and even helps fight climate change. Let’s unpack why protecting krill matters so much.

---

### 🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept

- Everything either eats krill or eats something that eats krill
- Krill also contributes to carbon sequestration in oceans

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What makes krill so important to Antarctic ecosystems?

A) They clean the ocean

B) They are a key food source for many species ✅

C) They fertilise coral reefs

D) They control shark populations

- Researchers monitor how whales’ feeding patterns are changing with warming seas

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What is the current conservative krill catch trigger set by CCAMLR?

A) 1 million tonnes

B) 620,000 tonnes ✅

C) 5.6 million tonnes

D) 100,000 tonnes
