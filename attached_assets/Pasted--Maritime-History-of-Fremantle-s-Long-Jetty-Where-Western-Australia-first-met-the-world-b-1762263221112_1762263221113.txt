# ⚓ **Maritime History of Fremantle’s Long Jetty**

*Where Western Australia first met the world by sea.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Before Fremantle Harbour existed, ships once anchored offshore and unloaded their cargo onto a wooden jetty stretching far into the sea.

This was **Fremantle’s Long Jetty** — the beating heart of Western Australia’s trade in the late 1800s.

Today, its remnants rest beneath the water near Bathers Beach, forming both a heritage site and a home for marine life.

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **The Long Jetty** was built in **1873**, extending **over 700 m** from shore to deep water so ships could load and unload directly.
- It handled **timber, wool, whale oil, and passengers** during WA’s colonial expansion.
- By the 1890s, its shallow approach limited larger vessels, leading to the construction of the modern **Fremantle Inner Harbour (1897)**.
- The jetty was later dismantled, but remnants remain visible to divers and snorkellers.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

Why was Fremantle’s Long Jetty built so far out to sea?

a) To reach deep water for ocean-going ships ✅

b) To create a fishing platform

c) To block coastal erosion

d) To test new timber designs

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- Built by the **Harbour Works Department** using **jarrah timber** from WA’s southwest forests.
- Served merchant ships trading with **Britain, India, and Asia**.
- Today, **archaeologists and local dive groups** map its remains as part of Fremantle’s underwater heritage trail.
- Marine growth — **sponges, seagrass, and small reef fish** — now colonise the jetty piles, blending history with habitat.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which material was primarily used to build the Long Jetty?

a) Jarrah timber ✅

b) Iron and steel

c) Limestone

d) Concrete

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- By the 1890s, **sand movement and shallow depths** made navigation difficult.
- **Storm damage** and the need for deeper berths led to its replacement by Fremantle Harbour.
- Much of the jetty was demolished, but **submerged timbers remain protected** under WA’s *Maritime Archaeology Act*.
- Its story reminds us how engineering, environment, and economy constantly reshape the coastline.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

What was the main reason the Long Jetty was replaced?

a) It was destroyed by a cyclone

b) It was too shallow for larger vessels ✅

c) It was sold to private owners

d) It caught fire
