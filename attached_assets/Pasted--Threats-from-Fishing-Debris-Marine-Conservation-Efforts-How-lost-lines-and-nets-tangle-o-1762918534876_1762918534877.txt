# **Threats from Fishing Debris & Marine Conservation Efforts**

*How lost lines and nets tangle our oceans — and what we can do about it.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

You’ve probably seen it — a tangle of fishing line around a jetty pylon, or a snagged hook on the reef.

Discarded or lost fishing gear, known as **fishing debris or ghost gear**, poses one of the biggest hazards to marine life.

But through awareness, clean-ups, and better gear design, ocean users are turning the tide.

---

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Fishing debris** includes lost nets, lines, hooks, sinkers, and traps.
- When abandoned, this gear keeps catching animals — a process called **ghost fishing**.
- Species like **sea lions, seabirds, turtles, and reef fish** are most at risk from entanglement or ingestion.
- The problem is global but visible locally around **Perth jetties, Rottnest reefs, and Cockburn Sound**.
- Conservation programs now focus on **prevention, retrieval, and education** — for example, the **Reel It In** campaign installs fishing-line recycling bins at WA jetties and boat ramps to stop line entering the water.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What is “ghost fishing”?

a) Fishing done at night

b) Ongoing capture of animals by lost gear ✅

c) Fishing with sonar

d) A traditional fishing practice

### **🐡 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Common debris sources:** recreational line fishing from jetties, crayfish pots, trawl gear, and boat moorings.
- **Affected species near Perth:** sea lions at Shoalwater Islands, cormorants and pelicans around jetties, and rays and octopus at local dive sites.
- **Community heroes:**
    - **Tangaroa Blue Foundation** – runs the **Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI)** data network.
    - **Keep Australia Beautiful WA** and **local dive clubs** organise clean-ups at sites like Ammo Jetty and Woodman Point.
    - **Ghost Nets Australia** retrieves derelict gear from northern WA and Indigenous Sea Country.
- Divers, fishers, and citizen scientists now work together to remove debris and record what they find.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which group manages the Australian Marine Debris Initiative?

a) Fisheries Research Institute

b) CSIRO

c) Surf Life Saving WA

d) Tangaroa Blue Foundation ✅

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Wildlife entanglement** causes injury, drowning, or starvation.
- **Microplastics** form when lines and nets break down, entering food webs.
- Heavy debris can **smother seagrass** or break fragile corals.
- Clean-ups help, but long-term change needs **responsible disposal, biodegradable gear, and policy reform**.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why is discarded fishing line harmful even after years underwater?

a) It dissolves into nutrients

b) It can still entangle marine animals ✅

c) It becomes food for plankton

d) It repels fish from reefs

### **🧭 Step 5 of 6 – Final Quiz**

1️⃣ What term describes gear that continues catching animals after being lost?

a) Ghost gear ✅

b) Recycled tackle

c) Float gear

d) Reef net

2️⃣ What local area near Perth reports frequent entanglements of sea lions?

a) Marmion Marine Park

b) Geographe Bay

c) Shoalwater Islands Marine Park ✅

d) Coral Bay

3️⃣ Which action most effectively reduces fishing debris long term?

a) Annual clean-ups only

b) Sinking more artificial reefs

c) Banning recreational diving

d) Designing and using biodegradable fishing gear ✅

### **🌱 Step 6 of 6 – What You Can Do**

- Collect stray line and tackle safely — **cut, coil, and bin** it.
- Use **recycling bins for fishing gear** at jetties and boat ramps (marked “Reel It In”).
- Join a **marine debris clean-up** or log items in the **AMDI database**.
- Spread the message: prevention is easier than recovery.

🎉 **Wrap-Up Message**

Fantastic work! You’ve learned how lost fishing gear harms marine life — and how local actions, from dive clean-ups to smarter gear, make a lasting difference.
