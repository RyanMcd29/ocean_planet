## 🌊 **Ecosystem Guardians: Managing Krill and Whales**

*Why saving krill means saving the ocean*

**Level:** Advanced

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Antarctic krill may be small, but they feed the biggest animals on Earth. 🦐

These shrimp-like crustaceans are the foundation of the Southern Ocean ecosystem — vital for whales, seals, penguins, and seabirds.

---

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Krill = keystone species** of Antarctic food webs.
- Nearly every predator depends on krill directly or indirectly.
- Krill also help the planet — when eaten, their carbon-rich waste sinks deep, storing carbon.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

Why are krill vital to the Antarctic ecosystem?

A) They fertilise coral reefs

B) They provide food for many animals ✅

C) They reduce ocean salinity

D) They warm the water

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- The **AAD CAKE Project** studies krill-based ecosystem management.
- **CCAMLR** (Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) regulates fishing.
- Scientists monitor how whale feeding shifts with climate change.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What is CCAMLR’s conservative krill-catch trigger?

A) 620,000 tonnes ✅

B) 1 million tonnes

C) 3.2 million tonnes

D) 100,000 tonnes

---

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Climate change** reduces sea ice habitat where krill breed.
- **Ocean acidification** damages larval shell formation.
- **Commercial krill fishing** for oil and feed adds pressure to ecosystems.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why is krill reproduction under threat?

A) Whale predation

B) Ocean acidification and warming ✅

C) Reduced sunlight hours

D) Ship noise

### **Step 5 of 6 – Final Quiz**

1. What does it mean when a species is called “keystone”?
    - A) It builds reefs
    - B) It migrates farthest
    - C) It supports the entire ecosystem’s structure ✅
    - D) It’s the largest animal
2. How do krill help store carbon?
    - A) Their waste and bodies sink, locking carbon deep in the ocean ✅
    - B) They reflect sunlight
    - C) They photosynthesise oxygen
    - D) They build carbonate reefs
3. What is one major human-driven risk to krill populations?
    - A) Deep-sea mining
    - B) Overfishing for krill oil products ✅
    - C) Whale watching boats
    - D) Scuba diving

### **🌱 Step 6 of 6 – What You Can Do**

🦐 Avoid krill oil supplements – choose algae-based alternatives.

🌊 Support sustainable fisheries and Antarctic MPAs.

📣 Share why krill are the hidden heroes of our planet’s carbon cycle.
