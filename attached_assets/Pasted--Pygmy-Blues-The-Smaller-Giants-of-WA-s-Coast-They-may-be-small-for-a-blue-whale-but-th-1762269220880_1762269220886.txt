# **Pygmy Blues: The Smaller Giants of WA’s Coast**

*They may be “small” for a blue whale, but they’re still ocean giants.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Imagine standing on the cliffs near Perth Canyon and seeing a 24-metre whale glide past. 🐋

These are **pygmy blue whales** — slightly smaller cousins of the Antarctic blue whale — and Western Australia is one of the few places where you can see them on their migration.

---

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Pygmy blue whales** grow up to 24 m, weighing as much as 3,000 people.
- They are a distinct subspecies of blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda*).
- WA’s **Perth Canyon** is a critical feeding ground, rich in krill.
- Listed as *Endangered*, with global populations still recovering from whaling.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

Where is WA’s famous feeding hotspot for pygmy blue whales?

A) Ningaloo Reef

B) Perth Canyon ✅

C) Shark Bay

D) Swan River

---

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Species:** Pygmy blue whales — migrate annually along WA’s coast.
- **Food:** Swarms of krill that concentrate in submarine canyons.
- **Researchers:** Use satellite tags, acoustic recorders, and aerial surveys.
- **Community:** Eco-tours and citizen scientists report sightings.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What do pygmy blue whales primarily feed on?

A) Krill ✅

B) Small fish

C) Seaweed

D) Jellyfish

---

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Ship strikes** in busy shipping lanes near Fremantle.
- **Noise pollution** interfering with whale communication.
- **Climate change** affecting krill abundance and distribution.
- **Slow recovery** — blue whales reproduce very slowly.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why are pygmy blue whales vulnerable to climate change?

A) They depend on krill, which may decline with warming seas ✅

B) They only live in rivers

C) They avoid deep water

D) They breathe less often

## **Step 5 of 6 – Final Quiz**

1. How large can pygmy blue whales grow?
    - A) 10 m
    - B) 24 m ✅
    - C) 50 m
    - D) 5 m
2. Which threat is linked to busy shipping routes off WA?
    - A) Plastic ingestion
    - B) Ship strikes ✅
    - C) Coral bleaching
    - D) Overfishing
3. Why is the pygmy blue whale population still low?
    - A) Natural predators
    - B) Too much diving tourism
    - C) Lack of food
    - D) Historic whaling and slow reproduction ✅

### **🌱 Step 6 of 6 – What You Can Do**

🐋 Support whale-safe eco-tourism operators.

🌊 Reduce ocean noise: back policies for quieter shipping lanes.

📣 Share whale sightings with citizen science platforms.

♻️ Tackle climate change — protecting krill means protecting whales.
