## 🐋 Southern Right Whales: Migration Mysteries

🧭 *Inspired by real-world research from the Southern Ocean*

### 👣 **Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Southern right whales were once hunted nearly to extinction. While their numbers are now slowly recovering, there’s still a big mystery:

**Where do they go to feed during the summer?**

Scientists know they come to the southern coast of Australia and New Zealand in winter to give birth, but their summer foraging grounds in the Southern Ocean are largely unknown.

🔍 *Tracking their migration could help protect them more effectively.*

### 🧠 **Step 2 of 5 – How Scientists Are Solving the Mystery**

To understand these elusive journeys, scientists launched the **Tohorā Voyages** research project.

Here’s how they’re gathering clues:

- **Satellite tagging** – Tracks whale movements across thousands of kilometres
- **Skin sampling** – Reveals DNA, diet, and connections between populations
- **Photo-ID** – Uses unique callosity patterns (like fingerprints!) to ID individuals

🐋 One whale, *Whitu*, travelled over **10,000 km** from the Auckland Islands to Esperance, WA — a surprising discovery!

### 🌐 **Step 3 of 5 – Why This Research Matters**

Understanding migration helps with:

- Protecting key feeding grounds
- Connecting populations across Australia and NZ
- Monitoring whale health and diet
- Supporting national conservation plans

📷 It also helps us update photo databases and understand how human activity affects these endangered whales.

⚠️ Fun fact: Some rare “white” whale calves appear along WA’s coast — they’re not albino, just naturally pale. These whales attract attention, but they need space — **stay 500m away** to avoid disturbing them.
