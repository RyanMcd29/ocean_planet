👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction
More than 60% of the ocean lies beyond any country’s borders — these are the high seas, and they’ve long been lawless when it comes to conservation.
That’s about half the planet with very few rules on how it's protected.
But in 2023, something big changed: the world agreed on a High Seas Treaty to help protect ocean biodiversity for the first time ever.

🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Why It Matters
The high seas are full of life — whales, tuna, sharks, plankton — and vital to Earth’s climate and ecosystems.
Until now, there’s been no legal framework to create marine protected areas in these international waters.
The treaty will now allow countries to:

Create marine protected areas (MPAs) beyond national waters

Share marine genetic resources more fairly

Assess environmental impacts of high-seas activities (like deep-sea mining or shipping)

📊 Step 3 of 5 – Quiz Time!
Which of the following is true about the High Seas Treaty?
A) It only applies to coastal reefs
B) It allows the creation of protected zones in international waters ✅
C) It bans all fishing in the ocean
D) It only affects countries in the Pacific

✅ Correct answer: B

🌍 Step 4 of 5 – Global Collaboration
Over 190 countries agreed to the treaty after nearly 20 years of negotiation.
It’s a big step forward in hitting the 30x30 goal — to protect 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030.
But signing the treaty isn’t enough. Each country must now ratify it and implement the rules at home.

🧠 Quick Question
What does the “30x30 goal” aim to protect?
A) 30% of national parks
B) 30% of Earth’s forests
C) 30% of land and ocean by 2030 ✅
D) 30 species each year

✅ Correct answer: C

🌱 Step 5 of 5 – What You Can Do
This treaty shows that global action for ocean protection is possible — and urgently needed.
Even if you don’t live near the high seas, your voice matters.

🫧 What you can do:
🌊 Stay informed and share ocean wins like this treaty

🐟 Choose sustainably sourced seafood

📣 Support policies that protect marine biodiversity

🫱 Ask leaders to ratify the treaty in your country

🤝 Join or follow ocean conservation groups working on high seas issues

🎉 Great job! You’ve completed the mini lesson on the High Seas Treaty.
