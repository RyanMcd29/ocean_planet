# **Orca Mysteries: The Apex Predators of Bremer Bay**

*WA’s deep canyon hosts one of the ocean’s most powerful hunters.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Every summer, hundreds of orcas gather off Bremer Bay, turning the remote south coast of WA into a hotspot for whale watchers and scientists. 🐋⚡

Known as **apex predators**, orcas (killer whales) sit at the very top of the food chain — but much about their lives in WA remains a mystery.

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- Orcas (*Orcinus orca*) are the **largest members of the dolphin family**.
- Highly social → live in pods with complex family structures.
- Bremer Bay Canyon is one of the **best places in the world** to see orcas.
- Scientists still don’t fully understand why they gather there — likely food (squid, beaked whales).

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What family do orcas belong to?

A) Whale family

B) Dolphin family ✅

C) Seal family

D) Shark family

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Species:** Orcas, plus other visitors (sperm whales, pilot whales, giant squid).
- **Researchers:** track hunting behavior, acoustics, genetics.
- **Tour operators:** eco-cruises in Bremer Bay bring people face-to-face with wild orcas.
- **Community:** tourists, photographers, and local businesses benefit from eco-tourism.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What other large animals are often seen with orcas at Bremer Bay?

A) Crocodiles

B) Penguins

C) Sperm whales ✅

D) Dugongs

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Mystery diets:** orcas may be targeting squid, sharks, or even other whales.
- **Noise pollution:** ship traffic can interfere with communication.
- **Ecosystem role:** as apex predators, they shape prey populations.
- **Tourism balance:** eco-cruises bring awareness but must minimize disturbance.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why is Bremer Bay important for orca research?

A) It is one of the few predictable gathering sites ✅

B) Orcas are bred there

C) It is a whale sanctuary only

D) Orcas migrate there to hibernate
