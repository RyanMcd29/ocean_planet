# **Humpback Highway: Following WA’s Annual Whale Parade**

*One of the greatest migrations on Earth passes right by WA’s coast.*

---

### **👣 Step 1 of 5 – Introduction**

Every winter, Western Australia’s coastline becomes a highway for giants. 🐋✨

Humpback whales travel thousands of kilometers between Antarctica and WA, putting on spectacular displays of breaching, tail-slapping, and singing along the way.

---

### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Humpback migration** = one of the longest in the animal kingdom (~10,000 km).
- They feed on krill in Antarctica, then migrate north to breed and calve in WA’s warm waters.
- WA’s coast hosts one of the **largest humpback populations in the world** (over 40,000 individuals).
- Whale watching from Albany, Exmouth, and Ningaloo is world-renowned.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

Why do humpback whales migrate to WA’s warm waters?

A) To feed on krill

B) To breed and raise calves ✅

C) To avoid predators

D) To find seaweed

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Species:** Humpback whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*).
- **People:** Whale watchers, researchers, Indigenous communities, eco-tourism operators.
- **Behaviours:** breaching, spy-hopping, tail-slapping, complex songs by males.
- **Cultural link:** Whales hold significance in many Indigenous Dreaming stories along WA’s coast.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

What behavior is humpbacks especially famous for?

A) Leaping out of the water (breaching) ✅

B) Sleeping on the surface all day

C) Digging in the sand

D) Spinning like dolphins

---

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- **Ship strikes** along busy shipping routes.
- **Entanglement** in fishing gear and marine debris.
- **Climate change** → shifting krill supplies in Antarctica.
- **Noise pollution** → interferes with humpback songs.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Why are humpback whale songs important?

A) They help whales sleep

B) They are used to communicate and attract mates ✅

C) They scare away predators

D) They produce food
