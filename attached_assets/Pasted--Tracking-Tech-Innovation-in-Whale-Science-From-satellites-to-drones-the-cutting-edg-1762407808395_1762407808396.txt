### **🧠 Step 2 of 5 – Key Concept**

- **Sonobuoys** detect underwater calls across hundreds of kilometres.
- **Acoustic moorings** record year-round ocean soundscapes.
- **Satellite tags** send daily GPS positions and dive data.
- **Drones & photogrammetry** measure body length, health, and even pregnancy clues.

✅ **Quiz 1:**

What were sonobuoys originally built to do?

A) Measure sea temperature

B) Track fishing vessels

C) Listen for submarines ✅

D) Detect ice thickness

### **🐠 Step 3 of 5 – Who or What’s Involved?**

- **Australian Antarctic Division (AAD)** designs durable, low-impact tags.
- **IWC & SORP programs** share global whale tracking data.
- **Researchers** from UWA and CSIRO use drones to study humpback body condition.

✅ **Quiz 2:**

Which whale species was found migrating between Australia and New Zealand?

A) Minke whale

B) Humpback whale ✅

C) Fin whale

D) Bryde’s whale

### **🌊 Step 4 of 5 – Challenges or Consequences**

- Balancing scientific value with animal welfare — every tag deployment is reviewed ethically.
- Acoustic pollution from ships can mask whale calls.
- Krill decline and warming seas reduce feeding success for Antarctic whales.

✅ **Quiz 3:**

Which whale can consume around 4.9 million krill a day?

A) Antarctic blue whale ✅

B) Humpback whale

C) Orca

D) Sperm whale
