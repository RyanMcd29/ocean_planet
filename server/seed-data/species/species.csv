Whitebarred Boxfish ✔,Actinopterygii,Least Concern,#NAME?,Eukarya,Aracanidae,Anoplocapros,"🔍 Identification
• Bright orange to reddish-orange body, very striking in the water.
• A thick white vertical bar behind the head — the most defining feature.
• Box-shaped, rigid body (carapace) typical of Aracanidae boxfishes.
• Small, rounded fins that flick rapidly for slow, hovering movement.
• Blunt snout with small mouth; eyes set high on the head.
• Tail is short and rounded, often slightly translucent.
🌊 Distribution & Habitat
• Endemic to southern Australia, especially common in Western Australia.
• Seen frequently around:
    ◦ Rottnest Island
    ◦ Perth metro reefs
    ◦ Geographe Bay
    ◦ South coast and Great Australian Bight
• Found on:
    ◦ rocky reefs
    ◦ sponge gardens
    ◦ deep ledges
    ◦ mixed kelp areas
• Depth range: 5–120 m

(Shallower around Rottnest; deeper individuals found further offshore.)
🐠 Behaviour & Ecology
Swimming style
• Slow swimmers — they hover using pectoral and dorsal fin flicks.
• Their rigid body doesn’t bend, unlike leatherjackets or wrasses.
Defence & toxins
• When stressed, boxfishes can release ostracitoxin, a potent skin toxin that deters predators.
• (They don’t pose danger to divers unless handled.)
Diet
Feeds mainly on:
• sponges
• small crustaceans
• worms
• benthic invertebrates
• occasionally algae
Social behaviour
• Usually solitary.
• Occasionally seen in loose pairs or small groups around reef edges.
📏 Size
• Common size: 18–25 cm
• Maximum: ~30 cm
🧬 Sexual Differences
Unlike many wrasses or leatherjackets, males and females look quite similar.

Juveniles show multiple white bands, which reduce to the classic single white bar in adults.
🤿 Notes for Divers
• Very approachable, slow-moving, and easy to photograph.
• Often found near caves, overhangs, and sponge patches.
• May turn sideways and freeze when approached — a defensive behaviour.
• Because their body is rigid, sudden turns are slow and predictable.
🧠 Fun & Useful Fact
Boxfishes (family Aracanidae) are incredibly hydrodynamically efficient: engineers have studied their boxy body shape because it allows stable, low-energy hovering — inspiring underwater drone designs.",Animalia,"

Shaw’s Cowfish ✔,Actinopterygii,Least Concern,"Rottnest Island, Perth offshore reefs, Busselton Jetty region, Albany reefs, Esperance archipelago",Eukarya,Aracanidae,Aracana,"🔍 Identification
• One of WA’s most distinctive boxfishes due to its pattern of pale spots or lines arranged in rings or swirls (“aurita” means ear-shaped patterns).
• Males typically show stronger blue or pale markings; females and juveniles are more brown-orange.
• Rigid, armour-like carapace of fused bony plates — the body cannot bend.
• Fins are small and rounded, producing a slow hovering movement.
🌊 Distribution & Habitat
• Common around Rottnest, Perth, Bunbury, Busselton, south coast reefs, Esperance, and eastwards into SA.
• Prefers:

    ◦ rocky reef
    ◦ kelp edges
    ◦ sponge gardens
    ◦ seagrass margins
• Depth: 10–100 m, usually deeper than Whitebarred Boxfish.
🐠 Behaviour & Ecology
Swimming & movement
• Slow, stable swimmers using small side-fins and dorsal fin pulses — extremely hydrodynamically efficient.
• Cannot turn quickly due to their rigid body; relies on fin control rather than body flexing.
Defence
• Protected by a highly developed, enclosed carapace (more reinforced than the typical Indo-Pacific boxfish).
• When threatened, may release toxins (ostracitoxin) into the water, like most boxfish.
Diet
• Omnivorous grazer feeding on:

    ◦ sponges
    ◦ small benthic crustaceans
    ◦ worms
    ◦ ascidians
    ◦ soft algae
• Bites are precise due to their small, beak-like mouth.
Sexual dimorphism
• Males often have brighter, more contrasting patterns.
• Females and juveniles are browner, with muted markings.
• Pattern can vary regionally.
Social behaviour
• Mostly solitary, occasionally in pairs.
• Moves calmly around reef edges and slopes.
📏 Size
• Common size: 12–18 cm
• Max size: 20–22 cm
🤿 Notes for Divers
• A very calm and approachable species.
• Often seen near sponge outcrops or low caves on deeper dives.
• Due to slow swimming, easy to photograph — but avoid hovering too close as prolonged stress increases toxin risk.
🧠 High-Value Learning Concepts
(Useful for Ocean Planet educational features)
1. Boxfish Hydrodynamics
Shaw’s Boxfish demonstrates how a “boxy” shape can still be extremely stable, inspiring underwater drone and robotics designs.
2. Evolution of Carapace Armour

    ◦ small fishes
    ◦ crustaceans
    ◦ cephalopods
    ◦ benthic invertebrates
• Usually lies still on the bottom, then lunges rapidly at passing prey.

🧬 Morphology & Adaptations
• Belongs to Aulopiformes, a group including lizardfishes and tripodfishes.

• Nocturnal hunters — far more active at night.
Reproduction
• Oviparous (egg-laying).

• Eggs are wedged into rock crevices to prevent predators from removing them.
• One of the most iconic shark breeding strategies in Australian waters.
Social behaviour
• Known to form seasonal aggregations, sometimes with dozens resting together.
• Generally docile and tolerant of divers.
🧬 Adaptations
• Large spiracles allow bottom-breathing while stationary.
• Dorsal spines provide protection against larger predators.
• Harness pattern serves as disruptive camouflage among rocks and kelp shadows.
• Very strong jaw plates evolved for durophagy (crushing hard-shelled prey).
